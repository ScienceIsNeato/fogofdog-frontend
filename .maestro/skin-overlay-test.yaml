# Test: Map Skinning Overlay
# Purpose: Verify users can apply and remove map skins through settings
#
# Acceptance Criteria:
# 1. User can open settings menu
# 2. User can navigate to skin settings
# 3. User can see available skins (or empty state for MVP)
# 4. User can see active skin indicator (or "None" for MVP)
# 5. User can return to map view
#
# Note: For MVP, no skins are available yet (tiles not generated).
# This test validates the UI workflow is functional.
