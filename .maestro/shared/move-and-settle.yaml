# Shared Flow: Move to GPS location and wait for map to settle
#
# Sets GPS to the given coordinates, waits for the map to process the
# location change, then taps the "center on me" button so the map
# camera follows.
#
# Input environment variables:
#   MOVE_LAT  - Target latitude (required)
#   MOVE_LON  - Target longitude (required)
#
# Usage:
#   - runFlow:
#       file: shared/move-and-settle.yaml
#       env:
#         MOVE_LAT: "37.78925"
#         MOVE_LON: "-122.4324"

- setLocation:
    latitude: ${MOVE_LAT}
    longitude: ${MOVE_LON}
# Allow GPS update to propagate through the location provider
- waitForAnimationToEnd:
    timeout: 500
# Break follow mode via a small pan so the location-button tap below always
# re-enables it (fixes toggle alternation on consecutive move-and-settle calls).
- swipe:
    direction: LEFT
    duration: 200
# Re-center camera on new position (follow was just broken, so this always turns it ON)
- tapOn:
    id: 'location-button'
    retryTapIfNoChange: false
# Brief settle for camera animation — 500ms is enough for the pan.
- waitForAnimationToEnd:
    timeout: 500
